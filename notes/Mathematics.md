## Sum formulas
- Given: 1<sup>k</sup> + 2<sup>k</sup> + 3<sup>k</sup> + ... + n<sup>k</sup>
    - for k = 1 - sum = n(n+1)/2
    - for k = 2 - sum = (n)(n+1)(2n+1)/6

- <b>Arithmetic progression</b>: a sequence where the difference between two consecutive numbers is constant
    - eg: 3, 7, 11, 15
    - n(a+b)/2 
        - where: a is the first number in the sequence and b is the last number of sequence.

- <b>Geometric progression</b>: a sequence where the ratio between any two consecutive numbers is constant
    - eg: 3, 6, 12, 24
    - (bk-a)/k-1 
        - where: a is the first number in the sequence, b is the last number in the sequence and the ratio between consecutive numbers is k.
